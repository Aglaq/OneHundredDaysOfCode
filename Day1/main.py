# Day 1 - Working with Variables
# Day 1 - Project: Band Name Generator

# Greeting
print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator.") 
# Creating two variables, asking for city and pet's name
city = input("What's the name of the city you grew up in?\n")
pet = input("What's your pet's name?\n")
# Combining into one string, saving in variable and printing on the screen
band_name = print("Your band name could be " + city + " " + pet)


# Examples and exercises from Day 1
# print("Hello World!")
# print("Hello World!\nHello World!")
# print("Hello " + "Adam")
# print("Hello " + input("What is your name?") + "!")
# username = input("What is your name?")
